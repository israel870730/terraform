StatefulSet (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods, 
suitable for applications that require one or more of the following.

    Stable, unique network identifiers
    Stable, persistent storage
    Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
    Ordered, automated rolling updates

In this Chapter, we will review how to deploy MySQL database using StatefulSet and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) as PersistentVolume (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). 
The example is a MySQL single leader topology with a follower running asynchronous replication.
