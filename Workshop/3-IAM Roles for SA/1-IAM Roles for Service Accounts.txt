Fine-Grained IAM Roles for Service Accounts
You can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can then provide AWS permissions to the containers in any pod that uses that service account. 
With this feature, you no longer need to provide extended permissions to the Amazon EKS node IAM role so that pods on that node can call AWS APIs. 
The applications in the pod’s containers can then use an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI to make API requests to authorized AWS services.

The IAM roles for service accounts feature provides the following benefits:

Least privilege — By using the IAM roles for service accounts feature, you no longer need to provide extended permissions to the node IAM role so that pods on that node can call AWS APIs. 
You can scope IAM permissions to a service account, and only pods that use that service account have access to those permissions.

Credential isolation — A container can only retrieve credentials for the IAM role that is associated with the service account to which it belongs. 
A container never has access to credentials that are intended for another container that belongs to another pod.
